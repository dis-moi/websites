### Update the js profiles app

To force cache refresh : change the value in _Version JS Bundle pour la page "Les Contributeurs"_ in /wp-admin/customize.php?theme=divi-child-bulle _Configuration Bulles/Dismoi_

### Wishlist

* Add a Uglification to the CSS output without removing the style header comments

### URL and Redirection

`rewrite_rules` are used for `eclaireur` and `en/guides` path and redirection profiles pages.
To do that the function `function dismoi_profiler_rewrite_url( $wp_rewrite )` is used in `functions.php`
For any changes, Wordpress have to flush the `rewrite_rules` to apply the new change, to do that :
- go on backoffice
- find permalink page
- save with the button (no need to change anything else)

> saving will flush rewrite_rules and generate the new one
