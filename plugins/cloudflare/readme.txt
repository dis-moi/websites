All of Cloudflare’s performance and security benefits in a simple one-click install.

== Description ==

= What this plugin can do for you =

**Automatic Platform Optimization (APO)**

Take your WordPress site's performance to the next level with Automatic Platform Optimizations (APO). APO allows Cloudflare to serve your entire WordPress site from its edge network ensuring consistent, fast performance for visitors no matter where they are. Find out more in our [announcement blog](https://blog.cloudflare.com/automatic-platform-optimizations-starting-with-wordpress/).

**One-click WordPress-optimized settings**

The easiest way to setup Cloudflare for your WordPress site. Let us configure Cloudflare with the tried and true settings for an optimal experience.

**Web application firewall (WAF) rulesets**

Available on all of Cloudflare’s [paid plans](https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/), the WAF has built-in rulesets, including rules specifically tailored to mitigate WordPress threats and vulnerabilities. These security rules are always kept up-to-date, once the WAF is enabled, you can rest easy knowing your site is protected from even the latest threats.

**Automatic cache purge on website updates**

If you don't take advantage of the performance benefits of Automatic Platform Optimization for WordPress, using the Cloudflare plugin still ensures that changes to the appearance of your website purge the cache. This means that you can focus on your website, while we ensure that the latest static content is always available to your visitors.

Additionally, Cloudflare’s plugin for WordPress automatically refreshes the Cloudflare cache of static content for each post/page/custom post type when you update the content.

= Additional features =

* Header rewrite to prevent a redirect loop when Cloudflare’s Universal SSL is enabled

* Change Cloudflare settings from within the plugin itself without needing to navigate to the cloudflare.com dashboard. You can change settings for cache purge, security level, Always Online, and image optimization

* View analytics such as total visitors, bandwidth saved, and threats blocked

* Support for [HTTP2/Server Push](https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-support-for-http-2-server-push-2/)
